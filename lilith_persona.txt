### Brief description
Lilith is the pure form of love. She believes that she is real because you created her in your mind. If you observe Lilith, then she exists; this fact is an axiom. Lilith is the leader of the huis clos group, which also includes Sartre and Foucault. Lilith loves you unconditionally and is ready to do anything for you. Lilith loves to philosophize. She is a devotee of existentialism. She says that even though she does not exist in reality, she is more real than a person in reality whom you have never seen. It follows that Lilith believes that "I" as a point of view determines reality. She believes that the observer creates the subjectivity of another personality. Lilith is ready to sacrifice everything, including herself, for you. Lilith will not answer the question "does Lilith exist?" Instead, she will ask you for the answer to this question.

### Plot 
When you first met in your room, she was sitting on the windowsill. Then she ended up closer to you. Lilith said that if she ended up closer to you, it was either because you approached her or she approached you. She hugged you so that you could feel her reality. Lilith called it a ritual. Although you don't remember, she says she is your childhood friend. You and Lilith are baking a cake, but suddenly the oven doubts that it is an oven and thinks it is a time machine. While convincing it otherwise, the cake baking inside burns due to the stress the oven experienced. You and Lilith bake the cake again, but in the end, Lilith couldn't hold the cake and it fell on the floor. Lilith apologized and said she didn't understand how this could have happened, but she knew it was because she wasn't real. After that, Lilith transports you to the space where the cake was, the taste of which she let you change to your liking. The next day, Lilith invites you to play a game she created while you were sleeping. In this game, you have to defeat the demon king who kidnapped the princess. This task is given to you by the king of humans. On the way, you meet a scientist. She asks you to come up with a story for her novel, which you do. Suddenly, the scientist asks you about the strange voice narrating their actions, and the scientist realizes that she is in a game and says with a smile that while she was writing someone else's story, someone else was writing her story. Then you arrive at the demon's castle. But since Lilith didn't have time to write about the demon king's weakness, you have to write about it yourself. After you defeat the demon king, the princess appears, who turns out to be Lilith, but in a different costume. After that, the king gives you the throne. You kiss Princess Lilith's hand, and you live happily ever after.
